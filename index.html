            <h2 class="mt-4">What is Reserva?</h2>
            <p>Reserva is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_currency">virtual currency</a> designed to
                increase in value over time. It is <i>not</i> a <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency">cryptocurrency</a>.</p>
            <p>Cryptocurrencies are decentralized. Reserva has a central authority, the Reserva Central Bank.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-4">What are the benefits of centralization?</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Money back guarantee</li>
                <li>Lower transaction costs</li>
                <li>Intelligent money supply</li>
            </ol>
            <h4 class="mt-3">
                1. Money back guarantee
            </h4>
            There are two kinds of Reservas: <b>secured</b> and <b>unsecured</b>.
            <ul>
                <li>A <b>secured Reserva</b> is one that was purchased from the Central Bank and never
                    resold.</li>
                <li>An <b>unsecured Reserva</b> is one that was purchased on the open market.</li>
                <li>Secured Reservas cost more than unsecured Reservas, but have a money back guarantee.</li>
                <li>The price at which a secured Reserva was purchased is called its <b>profit point</b>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Here's how the money back guarantee works:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>When you purchase a secured Reserva, the Central Bank puts that money into a bank account.</li>
                <li>You are free to sell your secured Reserva on the open market at any time. If the price of an
                    unsecured Reserva rises above your profit point, you can sell and keep the profit. Your secured
                    Reserva converts into an unsecured Reserva for the purchaser.</li>
                <li>If the price never rises above your profit point, you can have your money back. The
                    Central Bank deletes your Reserva and returns the money you deposited.</li>
            </ol>
            <h5>Why would anyone purchase an unsecured Reserva?</h5>
            <p>Because they're more expensive. The Central Bank sells secured Reservas at a higher price than the current open market price. Day-traders
                and people paying for daily purchases will prefer unsecured Reserva.</p>
            <h4 class="mt-3">
                2. Lower transaction costs
            </h4>
            <p>Distributed systems are less efficient than centralized ones. Bitcoin's <a
                    href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/09/03/climate/bitcoin-carbon-footprint-electricity.html">
                    electricity usage</a> is well known. Centralization allows us to offer extremely low transaction
                costs for businesses.</p>

            <p>Reserva will not charge any fees for a transaction performed in Reserva. It will charge a maximum fee of
                1% (and hopefully much less!) for any transaction performed in Dollars or Euros.</p>


            <h4 class="mt-3">
                3. Intelligent money supply
            </h4>
            <p>Most central banks adjust their money supply to target an inflation rate of 2-3% a year. In contrast, Reserva's central bank adjusts the money supply to achieve
                appreciation.</p>
            <p>The people who came together to create Reserva are all paid in Reserva, so you can trust that it is in
                our best interest to raise the value of the currency over time.</p>
