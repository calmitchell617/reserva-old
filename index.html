            <h1 class="my-5">Welcome to Reserva</h1>
            <h2 class="mt-4">What is Reserva?</h2>
            <p>Reserva is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_currency">virtual currency</a> with two main
                objectives:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Lower transaction costs for day to day transactions.</li>
                <li>Increase in value over time.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="mt-4">Is Reserva a cryptocurrency?</h3>
            No. Cryptocurrencies are decentralized. Reserva has a central authority, the Reserva Central Bank.

            <h3 class="mt-3">Fiat currencies</h3>
            <p>Fiat currencies are the world's dominant currencies - the Dollar, the Euro, the Yen, etc. Most fiat
                currency
                central banks adjust their money supply to target an inflation rate of 2-3% a year, with occasional
                higher
                spikes. In contrast, Reserva's
                central bank adjusts the money supply to achieve appreciation.</p>
            <h3 class="mt-3">Cryptocurrencies</h3>
            <p>Cryptocurrencies, while having some value as a speculative asset, aren't very good for day to day
                purchases.
                The best known cryptocurrency network, Bitcoin, can only process around 5 transactions per second in
                the
                present day. Obviously, that isn't fast enough.</p>

            <p>There are lots of really smart people trying to solve this problem. However, until someone solves it, a
                centralized transaction processing system is the only way to keep up with the amount of transactions
                created
                by the modern economy.</p>
            <h2 class="mt-4">Why do merchants accept Reserva?</h2>
            <p>Reserva charges very low transaction fees, and merchants can immediately (and automatically) exchange
                Reservas for dollars at a guaranteed rate.</p>

            <p>Would you like to accept Reserva as a method of payment? All you have to do is <a href="#">download our
                    app
                    here!</a></p>

            <h2 class="mt-4">How does Reserva's value keep up with inflation?</h2>
            <p>Reserva is a free-floating currency. So how does Reserva's Central Bank influence the exchange rate?</p>
